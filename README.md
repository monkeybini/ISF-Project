# About Me
My name is Binyameen Mohamedy, a student at UJ Academy in grade 11. I am interested in Mathematics, Computer Science, designing things etc. I joined the Expo 

I made this page for ISF so that my project can reach a larger audience. My project is on pure mathematics, which makes it hard to explain without some prerequisites. This webpage makes it easier however due to a few reasons. I can be more informal and explain things in more intuitive ways. It is readily available to anyone who scans the QR code, leading to more people learning about this project who normally wouldn't.

Anyway, my main interest is in Number Theory, specifically the theory of prime numbers which studies various aspects of prime numbers and holds a central place in mathematics. In our modern day, prime numbers have found a key application in cryptography and digital encryption systems.

## My Project

My project aims to prove that a certain function, b(n), always produces prime or 1 values. It furthers the works of a previous researcher from 2003. It helped me uncover a new conditional proof of a theorem, one thats simpler and shorter but limited in other ways.  

## What did i do?
So what did i accomplish??

Well first let me give you a timeline to show you what i worked off of.

![](https://github.com/monkeybini/ISF-Project/blob/main/Timeline%20of%20events.png)

1. The way this function was discovered was through a summer school hosted by **Stephen Wolfram**. The summer school aimed to analyze complex behaviours arising from simple rules or definitions. One of the functions discovered was Rowlands function, b(n), the focus of my project. It is a type of recursive function, which means it relies on the previous terms value to compute the next term. Recursive functions and in general recursissions are fundemental tools used everywhere from finance to Large Language Models by A.I. 

2. Anyway, in 2008, Eric Rowland provided a conditional proof of the conjecture, meaning his proof shows that the conjecture is true if a certain hypothesis is true. It was not known if this hypothesis is always true or not. His work helped push this topic into the eyes of other mathematicians, which is why the function is named after him. 
He later made a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpaKpzMFOpg) explaining his work, how he proved his result, how the actual proof works, why its interesting etc. It's in a graphical style that math youtuber 3B1B popularised. I encourage you to check it out if you want to learn more but not read so much.

3. Years after him, a group of 3 authors, Fernando Chamizo, Dulcinea Raboso, Serafín Ruiz-Cabello, (**CRR** for short), studied a specific case of Rowlands function. When the initial condition is h=1. They were able to prove many things, through a very clever idea. Rowlands function is difficult to evaluate to they constructed a 'intermediate' function instead which related to Rowlands. Anyway they proved many things, but it was all conditional like Rowlands original work.

4. Now here comes me. I studied the function as is, and managed to show a few things conditionally unfortunately as well. I ran out of time to prove 2 propositions for my proof but i hope to do so before the end of the year and submit my work to a journal.
 - I have a draft of my research paper I'll eventual submit for publication, come at ISF if you'd like to read through it.


### List of results
Thats the timeline and the foundation i stood on at the beginning of this year. Anyway time for results

Anyway my proof assumes 2 hypothesis, one on estimating a certain sum and the other on a upper and lower bound for rowlands sequence. Either way, assuming those 2 I basically proved that:

 - Rowlands function, b(n), generates prime numbers or 1, once n is large enough.
 - Rowlands function generates infinitely many distinct primes.
   - In fact by proving this, I found a **different** and **new proof** of a theorem by the 3 researchers, CRR i mentioned. My proof is simpler and shorter than theirs but its not as flexible, you can't get as wide array of results as they did. Thats the limitation.
 - I also found a quicker proof of a proposition from Rowlands original paper, slightly improving his original paper as well.
   - Beyond that, numerically i discovered a new identity on the limit superior and limit inferior of the function.
 - A criteria on the initial condition that decides what types of primes it will produce. This answers a question Rowland asked in his orignal paper.


## What are recursive functions?

Now, Rowlands function, denoted as b(n), is a recursive function meaning its value at any point depends on the previous term. 
Examples of a simple recursive function would be, *f(n)= 2f(n-1)*. You get the sequence:
*2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64*

The function multiplies the previous term by 2. Note how u need to start with some number *f(1)* first. This is the initial condition for the function. In the example *f(1) = 2* gave u the sequence of powers of 2. but if *f(1) = 5*, the sequence would become:
*5, 10,20,40,80,160*

Rowlands function, *b(n)* is defined as follows:
*a(n)= a(n-1) + b(n)* for every *n>h* for some integer *h*, *b(n) = gcd(a(n-1), n)*

The definition is fairly simple, here gcd(a, b) means the greatest common divisor of a and b.

## How did i do it?
I initially analysed the problem numerically and graphically, and was able to formulate certain hypothesis which helped me understand the function more. It also helped me discover properties previous researchers missed, such as the criteria I mentioned. From there I had a key new idea on reformulating the problem differently which allowed me to use various other techniques to solve it. I can not say anything specific publically here due to various concerns but feel free to drop by at ISF, I can explain much more thorughly in person. Eskom Expo holds much more secure controls over project plagiarism/stealing ideas at ISF.

**How i learned mathematics**
Beyond that, the reason i was able to tackle this problem was not because i'm some math nerd or something. It's because after i got interested in mathematics, i approached learning it by conducting mini research projects. I'd take topics and problems, like polygonal numbers, and try to develop the field on my own. Of course those problems and topics were all well known, i could learn all of it through a google search. 

The point was to learn how to think about math problems. I did this for a while, re-discovering various ideas and theorems on my own, and this year i believed i was ready to tackle an actual unsolved problem. It has been the hardest, most time consuming problem ever, but i do not regret it. I encourage all learners to learn any science this way, its extremely slow but it teaches you alot.


## Significance?
I managed to find new, shorter and simpler proofs of various Theorems and propositions. 

Beyond furthering our current understanding of Rowlands function and prime numbers, this project also furthers South African mathematics. I encourage young learners to not think of mathematics as a school subject as i did in grade 8 but to explore it through the internet on your own. The internet can teach you so much if you use it wisely. Mathematics is what helps us understand the theory behind the world, such as how gravity works or how light travels. It quantifies intuitive ideas into logic which we can apply in other STEM fields. I think beyond that, mathematics is just fun.

### Foundations of A.I

Many fundemntal results in the theory of recursive functions such as the sum of a geometric series, end up used in financial maths for various reasons such as calculating annuities, depreciation, load repayments etc. Beyond finance, recursive functions are used by LLMs, Large Language Models, such as Chatgpt to generate text.

A.I tools like chatgpt and other text generetors are a form of extremely complicated recursive functions/recurssive processes. The way they work is by first starting with some word, then it looks at the previous text generated, and outputs a word based off it. So if you asked the A.I to generate a bed time story it will do so like this:

it will start off with some text, like *Once upon*, and generate the next word based off it, like *a*. so the sentence would be *Once upon a*, it will now look at that entire sentence and generate the next word, like *time*, making the sentence *Once upon a time*. This very very simply how A.I like chatgpt work. In practice it is much more complicated, using much more complicated mathematics that gives every word a probablity to be chosen based off the text already produced, all this after being trained on large amounts of data.

## Fun
Ask any questions at ISF, i'm happy to answer and coverse with you. Beyond mathematics i have a interest in Computer Science, Books, art and animation.
