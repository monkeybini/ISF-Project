## about me
my name is binyameen mohamedy, a student at UJ Academy in grade 11. I am interested in Mathematics, Computer Science and Graphic design. I made this page for ISF for 2 reasons, first is that im a nervous speaker IRL, and second is to reach a larger audience for my project. My main interest is in Number Theory, specifically the theory of prime number which studies various aspects of prime numbers. In modern day time, prime numbers have found a key application in cryptography and digital encryption systems.

## my project
My project is proves a Conjecture from 2003. It states that a certain recursive function, now called Rowland's function, always produces prime numbers or 1 as output. The way this function was discovered was through a summer school hosted by **Stephen Wolfram**. The summer school aimed to analyze complex behaviours arising from simple rules or definitions. One of the functions discovered was Rowlands function. It is a type of recursive function, which means it relies on the previous terms value to compute the next term. Recursive functions and in general recurssions are fundemental tools used everywhere from finance to Large Language Models by A.I.

## what did i do?
Now, Rowlands function, denoted as b(n), is a recursive function meaning its value at any point depends on the previous term. Examples of recursive functions would be the following, f(n)= f(n-1)<sup>2</sup>*. you get the sequence, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The function multiplies the previous term by 2. Note how u need to start with some number f(1) first, in the example f(1) = 2 gave u the sequence of powers of 2. but if f(1) = 5, the sequence would become, 5, 10,20,40,80,160.

## How did i do it?
I analysed the problem numerically and graphically, and was able to formulate certain hypothesis which helped me understand the function more. It also helped me discover properties previous researchers missed. From there I had a key new idea on reformulating the problem differently which allowed me to use various other techniques to solve it. I can not say anything specific publically here due to various concerns but feel free to come by, i can explain much more thorughly in person at ISF. Eskom Expo holds much more secure controls over project plagiarism/ stealing idea at ISF.

## significance?
Beyond furthering our current understanding of Rowlands function and prime numbers, this project also furthers South African mathematics. I encourage young learners to not think of mathematics as a school subject as i did in grade 8 but to explore it through the internet on your own. Mathematics is what helps us understand the theory behind the world, such as how gravity works or how light travels. It quantifies intuitive ideas into logic which we can apply in other STEM fields.   

### Foundations of A.I
Recursive functions are important types of functions in mathematics. Many fundemntal results in the theory of recursive functions such as the sum of any geometric series, end up used in financial maths for various reasons such as calculating annuities, depreciation, load repayments etc. Beyond finance, recursive functions are used by LLMs, Large Language Models, such as Chatgpt to generate text.

A.I tools like chatgpt and other text generetors are a form of extremely complicated recursive functions/ recurssive processes. The way they work is by first starting with some word, then it looks at the previous text generated, and outputting a word based off it. So if you asked the A.I to generate a bed time story it will do so like this.

it will start off with some text, like *Once upon*, and generate the next word based off it, like *a*. so the sentence would be *Once upon a*, it will now look at that entire sentence and generate the next word, like *time*, making the sentence *Once upon a time*. This very very simply how A.I like chatgpt work. In practice it is much more complicated, using much more complicated mathematics that gives every word a probablity to be chosen based off the text already produced, all this after being trained on large amounts of data.
