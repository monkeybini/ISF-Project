> ### God may not play dice with the universe, but something strange is going on with the prime numbers - Carl Pomerance/ Paul Erdos

## Intro
my name is binyameen mohamedy, a student at UJ Academy in grade 11. 

My project is solving a mathematics problem related to functions that generate prime numbers.
My project is basically solving a math problem related to functions that generate prime numbers. the function is called Rowland's function, and the problem was proving that the function always produces prime numbers or 1 as output. The way this function was discovered was through a summer school by **Stephen Wolfram**. The summer school aimed to analyze complex behaviours arising from simple rules or definitions. One of the functions discovered was Rowlands function. 

## what did i do
Now, Rowlands function, denoted as b(n), is a recursive function meaning its value at any point depends on the previous term. examples of recursive functions would be the following, f(n)= f(n-1)<sup>2</sup> ->  for n =1,2,3,4,5 you get 2,4,8,16,32,64. the function multiplies the previous term by 2. Note how u need to start with some number f(1) first, in the example f(1) = 2 gave u the sequence of powers of 2. but if f(1) = 5, the sequence would become, 5, 10,20,40,80,160

### Foundations of A.I

Rowlands function, the focus of my project is a recursive function. Recursive functions are important types of functions in mathematics. Many fundemntal results in the theory of recursive functions such as the sum of any geometric series, end up used in financial maths for various reasons such as calculating annuities, depreciation, load repayments etc. Beyond finance, recursive functions are used by LLM, Large Language Models, such as Chatgpt to generate text.

recursive functions are powerful tools in this world. A.I tools like chatgpt and other text generetors are a form of extremely complicated recursive functions. The way they work is by first starting with some word, then it looks at the previous text generated, and outputting a word based off it. So if you asked the A.I to generate a sentence on apples it will do so like this.
it will start off with a word, like apples, and generate the next word based off it, like "are". so the sentence would be "apples are", it will now look at that entire sentence and generate the next word, like "deleicous", making the sentence "apples are delicious". This very very simply how A.I like chatgpt work. In practice it is much more complicated, using much more harder to explain mathematics that gives every word a probablity to be chosen based off the text already produced, all this after being trained on large amounts of data.
