## about me
My name is Binyameen Mohamedy, a student at UJ Academy in grade 11. I am interested in Mathematics, Computer Science and Graphic design. I made this page for ISF for 2 reasons. First is that i'm a nervous speaker IRL, as all science lovers are. Second is to reach a larger audience for my project. I realised during regionals that it's difficult for people to see projects in crowded areas and that it would be better if they could get a overview of projects from their phones and decide themselves which one to visit and learn more about. Anyway, my main interest is in Number Theory, specifically the theory of prime numbers which studies various aspects of prime numbers and holds a central place in mathematics. In our modern day, prime numbers have found a key application in cryptography and digital encryption systems.


## my project
My project proves a Conjecture from 2003. It states that a certain recursive function, now called Rowland's function, always produces prime numbers or 1 as output. The way this function was discovered was through a summer school hosted by **Stephen Wolfram**. The summer school aimed to analyze complex behaviours arising from simple rules or definitions. One of the functions discovered was Rowlands function. It is a type of recursive function, which means it relies on the previous terms value to compute the next term. Recursive functions and in general recurssions are fundemental tools used everywhere from finance to Large Language Models by A.I.

Eric Rowland provided a conditional proof of the conjecture, meaning his proof shows that the conjecture is true if a certain hypothesis is true. It was not known if this hypothesis is always true or not. His work helped push this topic into the eyes of other mathematicians, which is why the function is named after him. He later made a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpaKpzMFOpg) explaining his work, how he proved his result, how the actual proof works, why its interesting etc. It's in a graphical style that math youtuber 3B1B popularised. I encourage you to check it out if you want to learn more but not read so much.

## What did i do?
Now, Rowlands function, denoted as b(n), is a recursive function meaning its value at any point depends on the previous term. Examples of a simple recursive function would be, f(n)= f(n-1)*2. You get the sequence, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The function multiplies the previous term by 2. Note how u need to start with some number f(1) first. This is the initial condition for the function. In the example f(1) = 2 gave u the sequence of powers of 2. but if f(1) = 5, the sequence would become, 5, 10,20,40,80,160.

One of my results on rowlands function is finding a criteria on its initial condition which decides the types of prime numbers it produces.

## How did i do it?
I initially analysed the problem numerically and graphically, and was able to formulate certain hypothesis which helped me understand the function more. It also helped me discover properties previous researchers missed, such as the criteria I mentioned. From there I had a key new idea on reformulating the problem differently which allowed me to use various other techniques to solve it. I can not say anything specific publically here due to various concerns but feel free to drop by at ISF, I can explain much more thorughly in person. Eskom Expo holds much more secure controls over project plagiarism/stealing ideas at ISF.

Beyond that, the reason i was able to tackle this problem was not because i'm some math nerd or something. It's because after i got interested in mathematics, i approached learning it by conducting mini research projects. I'd take topics and problems, like polygonal numbers, and try to develop the field on my own. Of course those problems and topics were all well known, i could learn all of it through a google search. The point was to learn how to think about math problems. I did this for a while, re-discovering various ideas and theorems on my own, and this year i believed i was ready to tackle an actual unsolved problem. It has been the hardest, most time consuming problem ever, but i do not regret it. I encourage all learners to learn any science this way, its extremely slow but it teaches you alot.


## significance?
Beyond furthering our current understanding of Rowlands function and prime numbers, this project also furthers South African mathematics. I encourage young learners to not think of mathematics as a school subject as i did in grade 8 but to explore it through the internet on your own. The internet can teach you so much if you use it wisely. Mathematics is what helps us understand the theory behind the world, such as how gravity works or how light travels. It quantifies intuitive ideas into logic which we can apply in other STEM fields. I think beyond that, mathematics is just fun.

### Foundations of A.I
Many fundemntal results in the theory of recursive functions such as the sum of a geometric series, end up used in financial maths for various reasons such as calculating annuities, depreciation, load repayments etc. Beyond finance, recursive functions are used by LLMs, Large Language Models, such as Chatgpt to generate text.

A.I tools like chatgpt and other text generetors are a form of extremely complicated recursive functions/recurssive processes. The way they work is by first starting with some word, then it looks at the previous text generated, and outputs a word based off it. So if you asked the A.I to generate a bed time story it will do so like this:

it will start off with some text, like *Once upon*, and generate the next word based off it, like *a*. so the sentence would be *Once upon a*, it will now look at that entire sentence and generate the next word, like *time*, making the sentence *Once upon a time*. This very very simply how A.I like chatgpt work. In practice it is much more complicated, using much more complicated mathematics that gives every word a probablity to be chosen based off the text already produced, all this after being trained on large amounts of data.

## Fun
Ask any questions at ISF, i'm happy to answer and coverse with you. Beyond mathematics i have a interest in Computer Science, Books, art and animation.
