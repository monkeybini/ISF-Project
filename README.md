# ISF project

my name is binyameen mohamedy, a student at UJ Academy in grade 11. 

My project is basically solving a math problem related to functions that generate prime numbers. the function is called Rowland's function, and the problem was proving that the function always produces prime numbers or 1 as output. The way this function was discovered was through a summer school by Stephen Wolfram. The summer school aimed to analyze complex behaviours arising from simple rules or definitions. One of the function discovered was Rowlands function. 

Now, Rowlands function, denoted as b(n), is a recursive function meaning its value at any point depends on the previous term. examples of recursive functions would be the following, f(n)= f(n-1)* 2 ->  for n =1,2,3,4,5 you get 2,4,8,16,32,64.

### Foundations of A.I

recursive functions are powerful tools in this world. A.I tools like chatgpt and other text generetors are a form of extremely complicated recursive functions. The way they work is by first starting with some word, then it looks at the previous text generated, and outputting a word based off it. So if you asked the A.I to generate a sentence on apples it will do so like this.
it will start off with a word, like apples, and generate the next word based off it, like "are". so the sentence would be "apples are", it will now look at that entire sentence and generate the next word, like "deleicous", making the sentence "apples are delicious". This very very simply how A.I like chatgpt work. In practice it is much more complicated, using much more harder to explain mathematics that gives every word a probablity to be chosen based off the text already produced, all this after being trained on large amounts of data.
